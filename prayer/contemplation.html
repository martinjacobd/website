<p>The word <em>contemplation</em> in common parlance usually denotes the same thing as meditation. In theological contexts, however, the word takes on a more specific meaning. The word contemplation comes from the Latin word <i>contemplatio,</i> which we usually see as a translation of the Greek word θεωρία (theoria, cf. theory, theatre), meaning to look at intently or gaze. In contemplation, as it is understood in theological terms, we gaze lovingly at the Lord and acknowledge His goodness and power. Contemplation, true to its roots, is a gaze.</p>

<p>Contemplation is not mere pontification. In other words, we are not thinking <i>about</i> God; rather, we are hiding in His providence and opening our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">hearts</a> to His love. Contemplation is also not meditation. This isn't the dwelling on of ideas; rather, the emphasis is more on the experience of God.</p>

<p>This is a profound experience. We open our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">souls</a> and look for the bit of Christ that God breathed into us. We then enter into His light, shunning the darkness of the outside world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contemplation is a <i>gaze</i> of faith, fixed on Jesus. <q>I look at him and he looks at me</q>: this is what a certain peasant of Ars in the time of his curé used to say while praying before the tabernacle. This focus on Jesus is a renunciation of self. His gaze purifies our heart; the light of the countenance of Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and teaches us to see everything in the light of his truth and his compassion for all men. Contemplation also turns its gaze on the mysteries of the life of Christ. Thus it learns the <q>interior knowledge of the Lord,</q> the more to love him and follow him.</p>

<p>&mdash;CCC 2715</p>

  <header><h3>How do we Contemplate?</h3></header>
  <p>How do we enter into this <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">inner man</a> and experience God? First, we bring the attention of our minds to God. Theophan the Recluse instructs us to <q>Stand with the mind in the heart.</q> What does this signify? It means that we go into the soul, standing before the divine presence of God. We do not abandon our capabilities of reason, but we make them also subject to the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>The age-old recommendation of the mystics is to use a prayer to be repeated over and again to take concentration away from spontaneous fantasies and thoughts and other products of the mind and place the concentration back on God in our heart. The prayer most commonly used for this purpose is the Jesus prayer. <q>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me, a sinner.</q> Similar prayers may be used, <q>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, through the intercession of the Blessed Mother, have mercy upon me.</q> Even, <q>Lord Jesus, have mercy.</q> The point is that we call upon the name of Jesus and in humility beg his mercy, lovingly remembering his sacrifice and bloodshed. Other prayers that have been used for this purpose are the words of the psalmist, <q>Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord.</span></q><a class="footref" id="ref1" href="#note1" title="This was suggested by St. John Cassian. A variant of this, namely, God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make haste to help me is said at the beginning of the hours in the Liturgy of the Hours.">1</a></p>

  <header><h3>Lectio Divina</h3></header>
  <p>The final stage in the Lectio Divina is contemplation. It is during this stage that, after having read and meditated on the word and praying for His intercession, we listen to what God has to say. It is a truly beautiful thing. In this stage, we enter into God's divine presence, in all humility, and submit ourselves, ordering all of our being to God.</p>

  <header><h3>The Dark Night of the Soul</h3></header>
  <p>It is also in contemplation that we enter into darkness. Of course, as I stated above, we look for the divine light of God, but this is darkness to the soul. We cannot rely on our rational faculties to know God. We cannot rely on our senses to know God. To know God, we must enter into total darkness. This idea is, of course, fleshed out totally by St. John of the Cross in his works <cite>The Dark Night of the Soul</cite> and <cite>The Ascent of Mount Carmel.</cite></p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>And this first night pertains to beginners, occurring at the time when God brings them into the state of contemplation; in this night the spirit likewise has a part&hellip;. </p>
	<p>Briefly, then, the soul means by this stanza that it went forth (being led by God) for love of Him alone, enkindled in love of Him, upon a dark night, <i>which is the privation and purgation of all its sensual desires, with respect to all outward things of the world and to those which were delectable to its flesh, and likewise with respect to the desires of its will.</i></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;St. John of the Cross, <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/john_cross/ascent.iv.ii.html"><a class="footref" id="ref2" href="#note2" title="The Ascent of Mount Carmel Book I, Chapter I, nos. 3, 4, emphasis added">2</a></p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>It is clear that if we wish to know God better and speak to Him contemplatively, we must first empty ourselves. We cannot rely on our own intellect and will to know Him. Rather, we must step out of the way and let God's grace step in. And be clear, without His grace, none of this would be possible.</p>

  <header><h3>Centering Prayer and the Danger of Illusion</h3></header>
  <p>Practitioners of centering prayer use a one-word mantra as a means of focusing their attention on God. Now, the truth is dwelling on any one word or phrase will help keep our attention in one place, but to think that this is the summit of Christian prayer life is to fall dangerously into <a  href="/mystic/illusion.html">illusion</a>. If we use this prayer&mdash;and this hasn't been specifically allowed by any competent Church authority, so we would do well to tread lightly&mdash;we must realize that no matter what a Christian life is a life of sacrifice. We cannot reach God except by the Cross, and any method that purports to be an easy way of reaching Him is a fraud.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any <i>man</i> will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Matthew 16:24</p>
