<p>The mystics use all sorts of terms to refer to the parts of man. We ought to understand these, so that we can understand, for instance, by what Bishop Theophan signifies when he says <q>Descend with the mind into the heart</q> and other such things.</p>

  <header><h3>Body, Soul, and Spirit</h3></header>
  <p>We first look at the metaphysical distinction of <i>the body, the soul, and the spirit.</i> To get a clue what these mean in the mystic's context, we'll first look at their Biblical meanings and interpretations.</p>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Body</h4></header>
	<p>The word translated <i>body</i> in the New Testament is almost invariably σῶμα (<i>sōma,</i> cf. <i>somatic</i>).[I got this information from <cite>Strong's Exhaustive Concordance,</cite> and the only times another word is translated <i>body</i> in the Authorized Version are in Acts 19:12 and Ephesians 3:6.] This doesn't give us much clue, as the word means body as in flesh and also body as in group, etc. However, in relation to a person, it always means their corporeal manifestation&mdash;their body. </p>
	<p>A lot of times people tend to dismiss the rôle of the body in spiritual life. They tend to think <i>My health is not so important as my prayer life.</i> This last statement might be true, but we must be very careful with this line of reasoning. It dangles dangerously close to a gnostic dualism&mdash;one which we even see today. A lot of people will say, <i>God doesn't care what I do with my body; he's really looking at my heart.</i> This is clearly condemned in the scriptures,</p>
	  <blockquote>
		<p>Flee fornication. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which <i>is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</p>
	  </blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;1 Corinthians 6:18&ndash;20</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>What, then, is the rôle of the body in the Christian's <i>spiritual</i> life? It's rôle is the rôle all of his other members play, namely to glorify God. In fact, this very same passage opens up a discussion about our body in relation to that of Christ. Christ's body and blood redeemed our own bodies.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Hebrews 9:13&ndash;16</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>God clearly cares a great deal about bodies&mdash;both ours and those of others. Clearly, a <i>bodily</i> sacrifice was required for the remission of sins. In fact, Christ's corporeal body was prepared as a paschal lamb would have been. His bones were unbroken at the Crucifixion.[John 19:33-36, a fulfillment of the prophesy in Psalm 34:20. This would have been a requirement of the paschal lamb (Exodus 12:46).] He offers us his body and blood also in the Most Holy Sacrament at the Altar.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;John 6:50&ndash;51</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>The word here translated flesh is σάρξ (<i>sarx</i>). This word means <q><i>meat</i> of an animal &hellip; or the <i>body</i> (as opposed to the soul (or spirit), or as the symbol of what is external, or as the means of kindred)&hellip;.</q>[<cite>Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, 4561</cite>] Here, we see very clearly that Christ's body (this is not a mere symbol) is our bread and giver of life.</p>
	<p>How, then, ought we to consecrate our bodies? This is also clear.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrific, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And be not conformed to the pattern of this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i>is</i> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Romans 12:1&ndash;2</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>In other words, we keep our bodies clean by fleeing from sin. Above, we see clearly the call to live chastely, but also in every other aspect, sin defiles us. The Word says Christ's <i>body</i> was without spot. Not just were his bones unbroken,[As prophesied in Psalm 34:20] a requirement of the Old Testament sacrifice, but His whole being was unblemished by sin. When we sin against God by defiling ourselves through unchaste conduct, we defile our body. Such sin is the ultimate rejection of a good body that has been given to us.</p>
	<p>It was the world&mdash;as we understand in the sense of our fallen state after original sin&mdash;which first defiled our bodies and forced us to cover it. So, we raise ourselves to new dignity by rejecting this world's pattern and showing respect also for our bodies</p>
	<p>Importantly, also, in the writings of the mystics especially, we find place for <i>bodily prayer.</i> This is the prayer of the lips&mdash;prasing God aloud&mdash;along with the prayer of the body&mdash;prostrating, genuflecting, and showing ourselves reverent even in gesture to the Lord. This is the prayer that is prayed in <cite>The Liturgy of the Hours</cite> and in the Eucharist, and, again, we must be careful not to denigrate this kind of prayer and so fall into some pseudo-spiritual, pseudo-gnostic pride that the body no longer matters. Clearly, this kind of prayer was given to all of us for good reason.</p>

	<header><h4>Soul</h4></header>
	<p>We usually understand both <i>soul</i> and <i>spirit</i>[In the Authorized Version, these terms are switched.]  to be the same thing.  For instance, we usually pray for the <q>poor <i>souls</i> of purgatory.</q> When we distinguish it from <i>spirit,</i> however, we undertand this as the rational and memorative faculties of man (also, Angels, Daemons, God, etc.). This corresponds to Greek ψυχή (psuchē, cf. psyche). We can also understand this as <i>mind.</i>[Although, in more technical language, the spirit would encompass both the mind and (mostly) the heart also the will, etc., but this is discussed later.] Bishop Theophan the Recluse writes,</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>The body is made of earth; yet it is not something dead but alive and endowed with a living <i>soul.</i></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Bishop Theophan the Recluse[As quoted in <cite>The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology,</cite> Faber and Faber Inc., New York, 1997 pp. 60-61. Emphasis mine.]</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>The soul does encompass the <i>mind.</i> It also encompasses our <i>emotions.</i> (Although the <i>heart</i> itself, as understood in mystic theology, is a bit of a different subject, covered below.) It also encompasses our <i>will</i>. All of these shall be discussed in more detail below.</p>
	<p>It is here that the prayer of the mind takes place&mdash;the concentration on what we are saying when we are saying it.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Spirit</h4></header>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Into this soul is breathed a spirit&mdash;the spirit of God, intended to know God, to reverence Him, to seek and taste Him, and to have its joy in nothing else.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Bishop Theophan the Recluse[Continuation of the above]</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>The <i>spirit</i> is what connects us to the uncorporeal. It was the spirit which God breathed into Adam, giving him special place among the animals and lower beings. It is the spirit with which we connect to God. It was the spirit which Christ commended into God's hands. And it is our spirit which God calls us to commend into His hands. It is our spirits which he saves and which will put on the wedding feast garment to join in the eternal supper. The <i>conscience</i> (properly understood as divinely inspired contrition, not mere intellectual <i>guilt</i>) is in the realm of the soul. The spirit is also connected to the third person of the Trinity&mdash;the Holy Spirit. Our spirit receives the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit speaks to us through our spirit. A little bit of God is implanted into each person in their spirit.  This corresponds to the Greek word πνεύμα (pnĕuma&mdash;lit., <i>breath</i> also vitality, cf. pneumatic).</p>
  </section>
  <p>With our body, we receive information through the senses. With our soul, we reason out information through our mind and emotions and recall these things from the memory. With our spirit, we connect to God and reason with the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <header><h3>The Heart</h3></header>
  <p>The term <i>heart</i> as the mystics understand it lies somewhat outside the traditional divisions of body, soul, and spirit. In fact, we would do good not to regard each of these things as so clearly defined and dividing. Especially in Eastern literature, we understand the heart as the core of man's <i>being.</i>  Anything which defines a person goes into the heart. Of course, this does include the traditional Western understanding of the heart as the center of <i>emotion.</i> Note, we also use this definition of heart, just not generally when speaking of persons. We will often say <i>the heart of the matter</i> to mean it's <i>essence</i> or <i>center</i></p>
  <p>This corresponds to the Hebrew לֵב (lêb), which does denote emotion but widely will and intellect also. We also have this corresponding to the Greek καρδία (kardia, cf. cardiac, etc.), of which Jesus speaks when he says,</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: These are <i>the things</i> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Matthew 15:19&ndash;20</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>And also,</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth evil things. But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Matthew 12:34&ndash;37</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>Clearly, our hearts are very important and very central. We must lose track of that there is a physical heart in each of us. It beats and God gives it its flow. It supplies our entire bodies with nourishment, and without its functioning, we would surely perish. To our vitality, the heart is essential and core.</p>
  <p>The heart is understood in a specific way (as <i>the deep heart</i>) as the inner man, that which was breathed into us (so connecting to our <i>spirit</i>).</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>The heart is the innermost man, or spirit. Here are located self-awareness, the conscience, the idea of God and of one's complete dependence on Him, and all the eternal treasures of spiritual life.</p>
	<p>The heart is to be understood here, not in its ordinary meaning, but in the sense of 'inner man'. We have within us an inner man &hellip;. It is the God-like spirit that was breathed into the first man, and it remains with us continuously, even after the fall. It shows itself in fear of God, which is founded on the certainty of God's existence, and in the awareness of complete dependence on Him, in the stirrings of conscience and in our lack of contentment with all that is material</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Bishop Theophan the Recluse[<i>ibid.,</i> p. 190, 191]</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  Bishop Ignatii also says of this organ,
  <blockquote>
	<p>When we read in the writings of the Fathers about the place of the heart which the mind finds by prayer, we must understand by this the spiritual faculty that exists in the heart. Placed by the Creator in the upper part of the heart, this spiritual faculty distinguishes the human heart from the heart of animals: for animals have the faculty of will or desire, and the faculty of zealousy or fury, in the same measure as man. The spiritual facutly in the heart manifests itself&mdash;independently of the intellect&mdash;in the conscience or consciousness of our spirit, in the fear of God, in spiritual love towards God and our neighbor, in feelings of repentance, humility, or meekness, in contrition of the spirit or deep sadness for our sins, and in other spiritual feelings; all of which are foreign to the animals.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Bishop Ignatii[<i>ibid.,</i> p.190]</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>They often quote <q>The inner man and the heart are very deep.</q>[Psalm 64:6] For the prayer of the heart to happen, we must come here to be face-to-face with the Lord God, our Creator. And it is very deep indeed, buried underneath all the sin and filth we've accumulated in our distancing from God. Indeed, the Kingdom of God is wihtin us&mdash;it was breathed into our souls.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Where does prayer come from? Whether prayer is expressed in words or gestures, it is the whole man who prays. But in naming the source of prayer, Scripture speaks sometimes of the soul or the spirit, but most often of the heart (more than a thousand times). According to Scripture, it is the <i>heart</i> that prays. If our heart is far from God, the words of prayer are in vain.</p>

  <p>&mdash;CCC 2562</p>

  <header><h3>The Mind</h3></header>
  <p>We signify two things by the mind, the <i>intellect</i>, which is the rational and memorative faculty of the soul, and the <i>imagination</i> (or mind proper) which is an extension of the memorative aspect of the soul. Nonetheless, when we are told to <q>descend with the mind into the heart</q>[Bishop Theophan the Recluse, <i>ibid.,</i> p. 63] we use the rational faculty but we abandon imagery.[<i>ibid.,</i> p. 100]</p>
</section>

<section>
  <header><h3>The Will</h3></header>
  <p>Products of <i>the will</i> are those things we consciously assent to. Spontaneous fantasies, images, and distractions, for instance, are products of the intellect, but if we choose to dwell on them, they become products of the will. Mortal sins are always products of the will. <q>Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.</q>[CCC 1857] In fact, it is even called a radical possibility of human freedom as is love.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Mortal sin is a radical possibility of human freedom, as is love itself. It result sin the loss of charity and the privation of sanctifying grace, that is, of the state of grace. If it is not redeemed by repentance and God's forgiveness, it causes exclusion from Christ's kingdom and the eternal death of hell, for our freedom has the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back. However, although we can judge that an act is in itself a grave offense, we must entrust judgment of persons to the justice and mercy of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;CCC 1861</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>How, then, is love a possibility of human freedom? Love is not love when it is coerced, it is merely external devotion. So, having the ability to love is to have the ability to choose. But there is always another option, a grave defilement of love. This also shows how even products of the mind are sins. They still defile love when fantasies come up&mdash;there is still the desire to defile love. Only acts of the will, however, separate us from God's grace because only acts of the will allow us to love in the first place.</p>
