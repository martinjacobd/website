<p>In some sense, ordinary emotions during <a href="/prayer/types.html">prayer</a> are irregular if not discouraged.[This is a point of contention. Many popular authors like to say that it's good to feel good during prayer, but I maintain that this feeling good can lead us into <a href="/mystic/illusion.html">illusion</a>. This comes from a common thought pattern; viz., If something feels good, then we seek out that something to feel good. This is the opposite of humility. So, I say, ordinary feelings during prayer are to be ignored. In fact, we would do good to ignore all distractions, including feelings.] However, during prayer, are <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">hearts</a> are pricked into contrition at times. At times, our hearts are elevated into a warm tenderness.[Cited from <cite>The Art of Prayer, An Orthodox Anthology,</cite> p. 124. compiled by Igumen Chariton of Valamo, Faber and Faber Inc. New York. 1997.] Most importantly, in our prayer, spiritual warmth of love for God is kindled. This is the work of the Spirit of God, present in each person's soul, burning him up.</p>

  <header><h3>Contrition</h3></header>
  <p><em>Contrition</em> is sincere sorrow for sins. Perfect contrition is sorrow for sin out of our knowledge of wounding Jesus. <em>Compunction</em> is the spiritual feeling of a pricking in the heart over sin. This has a very profound place in prayer. In our prayer, we stand before the Lord Jesus Christ and say, &ldquo;Lord, I've hurt you much&mdash;much more than I could ever repay. Through those wounds, have mercy on my soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To engender this contrition, perform an examination of conscience. We also may look at a crucifix or cross and recall the wounds of Jesus. We also may read the penitential Psalm 51 and reproduce within ourselves the same compunction.</p>
  <p>Contrition is not guilt. It is not a sense of reduced self-worth from dwelling on our sins. Contrition is also not shame. We are not merely reacting to another person's seeing our sin. We aren't even reacting in shame to God's seeing our sin. Rather, contrition is sorrow. Sorrow in the way we feel sorrow when someone else suffers&mdash;especially when that suffering is of us.</p>
  <p>We will never go wrong in prayer if we approach God in humility and contrition, recognizing all of our sins, begging His mercy, and expecting naught in return.</p>

  <header><h3>Warm Tenderness</h3></header>
  <p>This feeling of warm tenderness includes a feeling of contrition and also gratitude and joy about the mercy and graces He has given us. In fact, these latter seem to overshadow the visceral compunction. This is an overwhelming joy.</p>
  <p>We would do well not to persist or cultivate this state. This is a sort of odd spiritual hedonism that will surely lead us into <a href="/mystic/illusion.html">illusion</a>. Rather, as in all things, we humbly accept with gratitude this gift, and if it passes, we let it pass, obediently trusting in God's providence, judgment, and mercy. A contrite recognition of our lowly status should be ever-present.</p>

  <header><h3>Warmth of Heart</h3></header>
  <p>The warmth of the heart occupies a very profound place. All persons are made in the image of God, and in their <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">spirits</a> lies that image of God. Warmth of heart is yielding to this image and allowing it to take over us. God is love. True love&mdash;charity. When we allow His charity to fill our hearts, we act in charity. We cultivate faith. We lay in hope. Charity is kindled in prayer. This burning flame produces warmth that guides us to love. In this sense, we feel the warmth. But we also yield to God in that warmth, allowing the fire of His love to consume us.</p>
