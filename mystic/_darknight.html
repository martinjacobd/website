<header><h2>The Dark Night of the Soul</h2></header>
<p>A metaphysical perspective of the suffering of believers&mdash;and why we have to forsake our flesh for the Lord&mdash;lies in our opposition to the world.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hateth me hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;John 15:18-25</p>

  <header><h3>Lacan's Metaphysics</h3></header>
  <p>The Cross of Christ lies in direct opposition to the World. Christ made a dividing line when He made His sacrifice. We live in the world, and those who are of the world will not understand our lives. So, we will suffer. The flesh cannot comprehend God.[John 1:5] So, when we are given to earthly appetites and only experience happiness, we do not rejoice in God but in the World. This is a great gift. This is what John of the Cross referred to as the Dark Night of the Soul. It's dark, because to the senses of the <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">soul,</a> God is darkness. We cannot see Him. We cannot hear Him. We cannot touch Him. It is only in darkness to our senses and flesh that we can experience the Light of the Spirit.</p>
  <p>It is a trauma, in a Lacanian sense. French Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan proposed that all persons (Subjects) exist within a framework of the Other. This domain, the Other, contains all language and symbolism&mdash;all things which people can say they are or are a part of. He had a famous saying, &ldquo;There is no other of the Other.&rdquo; This means, all of our language, all of our symbols, all of our institutions only have meaning in terms of each other. This is demonstrated, e.g., in Genesis, when Adam must name the animals. God gave the use of language up to Adam. He didn't make any language which can convey all Real meanings. There is always a disconnect between record and reality.</p>

  <header><h3>The Trauma of God's Being</h3></header>
  <p>God traumatizes the Other of Lacan by being the standard. He said &ldquo;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">I am that I am.</span>&rdquo; He is indeed what is. He relies on nothing else to identify himself. Jesus makes statements identifying Himself as God also. John records seven of these, identifying Jesus as fully God, as His own standard which needs no Other reference.</p>
