<p>I'm Jacob Martin. Currently, I'm studying mathematics at <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>. You may reach me at <a href="mailto:jacobm@mit.edu">jacobm@mit.edu</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a Catholic catechumen, hoping to convert on the 2016 Easter Vigil. This site is mostly just an organization and compilation of my notes on my studies. These notes have no authority of themselves. The sources they quote do, so you should consult them.</p>

<p>I also like to code, mostly functional programming. I find it's easiest for me to learn by teaching, so I hope to post many tutorials on here.</p>
