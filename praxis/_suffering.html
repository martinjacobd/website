<p>A lot of the time, we are told to <i>offer up</i> our suffering to God. Many times, this is just an empty phrase. Sometimes, this is used as a subtle way to dismiss the other person's suffering. There is an underlying truth to this, though. In our suffering, we can also participate in Christ's suffering on the cross.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;1 Peter 4:12&ndash;13</p>

<p>How are we then to approach suffering. How do we suffer in a profitable way? Here, also, the Holy Spirit answers through Peter's Epistle.</p>

<section>
  <header><h3>Humility and Obedience</h3></header>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;1 Peter 1:13-16</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>So we see here the very first imperative: Obey God. And how do we obey God? We obey God by choosing not to sin. We choose not to conform to our former lusts. When we turn to these instead of God, we forfeit the graces we might obtain through suffering. Instead, we get our reward, namely, sated fleshly desires and spiritual longing and emptiness. Indeed, when we turn away from God, we open ourselves up to spiritual emptiness, living death, and Satan himself.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;1 Peter 2:21&ndash;24</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>So then, we see the fullness of the steps we ought to take. First, we do not sin. Next, we show love even to those who falsely accuse us, even to those who sadistically hurt us. Christ was an unblemished, perfect lamb&mdash;so innocent, Pilate's wife was afflicted over His accusers.[Matthew 27:19] His accusers accused Him of the vilest blasphemies, yet he did not react in rage to them. Rather, like a lamb to the slaughter, He calmly, charitably replied with the truth.[John 18:28-38] Jesus even assented to the power these cruel persons had over them, acknowledging that it was from the Father himself.[John 19:11] Cruelly, Jesus was unjustly mocked, scourged, and spat-upon. Yet towards all these people He was charitably, begging the Father's forgiveness of their souls in a profound act of Charity.[Luke 23:34] These persons mocked His divine power. In all of this, He acted, trusting in God's justice.</p>
  <p>We also, profoundly, must submit to the law's of our governments. The married couples among us must submit to one another, seeing one another as having authority over the other's body.[Of course, God's law trumps all other authority. Do not blindly obey authority that leads you into sin. You will still give an account of your actions.] We submit to due honor we must pay in respect to our parents. We submit to the holy interpretive authority given to the Church through the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>In this, we act in humility, admitting that we don't know better but rather we submit to authority. Included in this is an injunction against sin.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flash, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;1 Peter 4:1&ndash;5</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>Clearly, sin doesn't help us in our suffering. Sin feels good, and it can soothe us. But ultimately, if we persist in it, we will repeat the reward of our sin: death.</p>

  <header><h3>Charity</h3></header>
  <p>We must realize always the goal of our suffering for the cross&mdash;charity. When Christ suffered, He did not do so in vain, for the mere point of suffering. Rather, He sought the Cross because it was the will of the Father. He sought the Cross because ultimately, He knew that His suffering would bring salvation to many. He knew that His suffering was the charity that would cover a multitude of sins. His sacrifice was a profound act of love. He endured the shame of all the sin and suffering so that we could impute the same on Him.</p>
