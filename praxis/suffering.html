<p>A lot of the time, we are told to <i>offer up</i> our suffering to God. Many times, this is just an empty phrase. Sometimes, this is used as a subtle way to dismiss the other person's suffering. There is an underlying truth to this, though. In our suffering, we can also participate in Christ's suffering on the cross.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;1 Peter 4:12&ndash;13</p>
<div class="afterquote"></div>

<p>How are we then to approach suffering. How do we suffer in a profitable way? Here, also, the Holy Spirit answers through Peter's Epistle.</p>

<section>
  <header><h3>Humility and Obedience</h3></header>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;1 Peter 1:13-16</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>So we see here the very first imperative: Obey God. And how do we obey God? We obey God by choosing not to sin. We choose not to conform to our former lusts. When we turn to these instead of God, we forfeit the graces we might obtain through suffering. Instead, we get our reward, namely, sated fleshly desires and spiritual longing and emptiness. Indeed, when we turn away from God, we open ourselves up to spiritual emptiness, living death, and Satan himself.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;1 Peter 2:21&ndash;24</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>So then, we see the fullness of the steps we ought to take. First, we do not sin. Next, we show love even to those who falsely accuse us, even to those who sadistically hurt us. Christ was an unblemished, perfect lamb&mdash;so innocent, Pilate's wife was afflicted over His accusers.<a class="footref" id="ref1" href="#note1" title="Matthew 27:19">1</a> His accusers accused Him of the vilest blasphemies, yet he did not react in rage to them. Rather, like a lamb to the slaughter, He calmly, charitably replied with the truth.<a class="footref" id="ref2" href="#note2" title="John 18:28-38">2</a> Jesus even assented to the power these cruel persons had over them, acknowledging that it was from the Father himself.<a class="footref" id="ref3" href="#note3" title="John 19:11">3</a> Cruelly, Jesus was unjustly mocked, scourged, and spat-upon. Yet towards all these people He was charitably, begging the Father's forgiveness of their souls in a profound act of Charity.<a class="footref" id="ref4" href="#note4" title="Luke 23:34">4</a> These persons mocked His divine power. In all of this, He acted, trusting in God's justice.</p>
  <p>We also, profoundly, must submit to the law's of our governments. The married couples among us must submit to one another, seeing one another as having authority over the other's body.<a class="footref" id="ref5" href="#note5" title="Of course, God's law trumps all other authority. Do not blindly obey authority that leads you into sin. You will still give an account of your actions.">5</a> We submit to due honor we must pay in respect to our parents. We submit to the holy interpretive authority given to the Church through the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>In this, we act in humility, admitting that we don't know better but rather we submit to authority. Included in this is an injunction against sin.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flash, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you: Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;1 Peter 4:1&ndash;5</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>Clearly, sin doesn't help us in our suffering. Sin feels good, and it can soothe us. But ultimately, if we persist in it, we will repeat the reward of our sin: death.</p>

  <header><h3>Charity</h3></header>
  <p>We must realize always the goal of our suffering for the cross&mdash;charity. When Christ suffered, He did not do so in vain, for the mere point of suffering. Rather, He sought the Cross because it was the will of the Father. He sought the Cross because ultimately, He knew that His suffering would bring salvation to many. He knew that His suffering was the charity that would cover a multitude of sins. His sacrifice was a profound act of love. He endured the shame of all the sin and suffering so that we could impute the same on Him.</p>

  <header><h3>Participating in Christ's Suffering and the Dark Night of the Soul</h3></header>
  <p>Christ tells us in no uncertain terms that if we do not entirely renounce the world and suffer, our souls are in danger.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Luke 9:62</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <blockquote>
	<p>And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Luke 14:25-33</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>Most importantly, we must look at the cause of these sufferings. Now, some sufferings stem from our personal sin. For instance, if I rob a bank, the suffering I experience in prison will simply come as a natural consequence to my sinful actions. In these, there is little merit to bearing through them.<a class="footref" id="ref6" href="#note6" title="1 Peter 4:15-But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">6</a> But suffering in Christ, there is great rejoicing, as I have highlighted above. This suffering stems from the opposition of the world to Jesus's message and people.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>
	<p>The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
	<p>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Matthew 10:16-42</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>We see here the first reason that Christians will be persecuted and tried for the Lord's sake. Our persecutions are a consequence of our identification with the Lord. We cannot be greater than He, so if He is afflicted, so also are we. We hurt when the body of Christ hurts. And how he hurts at all the sin and filth in the world! How he hurts at His crucifixion, of which we also, as the Body of Christ, are a part! So, in a proper identification with Christ and His Holy Body, Our Church, we suffer because He also suffered. We also rejoice in His rejoicing. When even we are good to the least of His Brothers, we are good to His Body, for all of His Brothers a part of His Body.</p>
  <section>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hateth me hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;John 15:18-25</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>The Cross of Christ lies in direct opposition to the World. Christ made a dividing line when He made His sacrifice. We live in the world, and those who are of the world will not understand our lives. So, we will suffer. The flesh cannot comprehend God.<a class="footref" id="ref7" href="#note7" title="John 1:5">7</a> So, when we are given to earthly appetites and only experience happiness, we do not rejoice in God but in the World. This is a great gift. This is what John of the Cross referred to as the Dark Night of the Soul. It's dark, because to the senses of the <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">soul,</a> God is darkness. We cannot see Him. We cannot hear Him. We cannot touch Him. It is only in darkness to our senses and flesh that we can experience the Light of the Spirit.</p>
