<p><span class="intro">I</span> gave a talk last year to a group of high-school calculus students on parametric equations.  There was a lot of board-work and interaction involved, but for posterity's sake, I want to release these files here.  You can find the <a href="/resources/para-presentation.pdf">presentation</a> and <a href="/resources/para-handout.pdf">handouts</a> that I gave on this website.  You may use them however you wish, in jurisdictions where applicable, they are released under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 License from Creative Commons</a>.</p>

(There is an error on one of the slides where I made an accidental substitution \\(t \to x\\) that renders the equations non-sensical.)
