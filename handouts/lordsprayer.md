I gave a sermon in the winter on the Lord's prayer and wished to release my notes to the public.  After a long delay, here they go.  You can find [the long-form version of the notes](/resources/lords_prayer.pdf), [a version made with pdfbook suitable for printing double-sided and stapling into a booklet](/resources/lords_prayer-book.pdf), and [the latex source](/resources/lords_prayer.tex) here on my website.
