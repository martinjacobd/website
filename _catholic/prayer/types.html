<p>Prayer, simply put, is communication with God. It is the ordering of our thoughts and words to God's holy presence.</p>

<p>Prayer is a powerful force&mdash;one which we have too often taken for granted.</p>

<p>The mystics often distinguish between various types or kinds of prayer. Of course, all prayer is talking to God and resists definite classification, but we, in general, use these terms as convenience to discuss prayer.</p>

  <header><h3>Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Petition</h3></header>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Adoration</h4></header>
	<p>In <i>Adoration,</i> we adore God and praise Him. We realize exactly how highly exalted he is and exactly how lowly we are. It is this kind of prayer that the Lord speaks in when he says <q>Hallowed be thy name.</q> It is this kind of prayer that Mary prayed&mdash;and that we pray&mdash;in the Magnificat.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour; <br />
	  he has looked with favour on his lowly servant.
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Luke 1:46&ndash;47</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>We proclaim the greatness of the Lord when we adore Him. We kneel before his awesome power, recognizing our lowly state in comparison to his vast richness and glory. We become filled with awe at the splendor and majesty of Our King.</p>
	<p>This kind of prayer is all too neglected in today's world. A lot of the time, our prayers are wont to be lackadaisical and primarily petitionary. This kind of prayer should not be underestimated. When we pray, we pray so that we can get to know God better. God already knows all of our wishes and desires. We pray so that we can conform those to His will and not the other way around. In prayers of adoration, we surrender to God's divine might and power. We show just how lowly our desires are in comparison to His greatness.</p>
	<p>Of course, God already knows how awesome He is. Our prayer to Him increases our desire and loving reverence for Him.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Confession</h4></header>
	<p>In prayers of confession, we face God in true contrition. We realize the wounds our sin has inflicted upon Him, and we feel deep <i>sorrow</i> over those wounds. Note: this is not guilt of the mind which we ought to experience, although this guilt may <i>move</i> us to pray. This is also not <i>shame.</i> It is not a lament of a narcissistic injury due to our wrongs. Rather, this is a recognition of <i>His</i> suffering from our wrongs. And yes, every day, every wrong that you do, there was blood spilled for that, and it calls you to repent.</p>
	<p>Again, God already knows what we did wrong. Prayers of confession (penitentiary prayers) simply engender contrition within us, that we may keep our hearts purer. It is this kind of prayer that we pray in the act of contrition</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>O my God, I am heartily sorry for <i>having offended thee,</i> and I detest all my sins, because I dread the loss of Heaven and the pains of Hell, but <i>most of all because they offend Thee, my God,</i> who art all-good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;The Act of Perfect Contrition, Small Catechism of Bishop John Neumann</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>Note, here, the words, we detest our sins because of the offense they impose on God.<a class="footref" id="ref1" href="#note1" title="Of course, so-called imperfect contrition, i.e., sorrow for sins out of fear of hell or anything other than from our love of God, is still enough to make a sacramentally valid confession. However, the person will still not be in a state of grace until their confession. Perfect contrition along with resolve to go to confession soon ...">1</a> Of course, we always confess our sins <i>sacramentally,</i> and this prayer engenders that, not prohibits it. Many protestants like to say <q>I go directly to God to confess my sins.</q> I do too! That's why I accept the supernatural grace in the sacrament of confession also. Engendering love for God engenders love for the gifts He gave us, among which are the sacraments.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Thanksgiving</h4></header>
	<p>In prayers of thanksgiving, we give thanks for God's gifts. These gifts are numerous. Every breath we take is a gift, and we are not guaranteed another one. A key to a good relationship with God is loving gratitude, and prayers of thanksgiving engender this within us. Again, God already knows all of the wonderful gifts He bestows on us! When we recognize these, though, to Him, we engender our own gratitude. Paradoxically, recognizing the gifts of God recognizes how destitute we are. We recognize that without God, without even the smallest of His gifts, we would perish. So, we show gratitude for our life in prayers of thanksgiving.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Petition</h4></header>
	<p>Finally, we have petitionary prayer&mdash;requesting God's help. We see many examples of this in the Psalms, when the psalmist requests deliverance from an enemy. In fact, this is the primary mode of prayer we have in the Lord's prayer; He prays for a coming of God's Kingdom, the doing of God's will, and the giving of sustenance. This, also, simply points to our entire reliance on God. Everything we do, everything we get would not be possible without God's assent. We also recognize his divine soveriegnty. He rules over all the earth. By requesting things from his hand, we bow before that authority and in humility beg him.</p>
	<p>We notice that almost always, petitionary prayer is given in the form of a command. <q><i>Give</i> us this day our daily bread.</q><q>From the desire of being loved, <i>deliver</i> me, Jesus.</q> <q>O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, <i>have</i> mercy upon me.</q> This seems strange. Who are we to command God? But indeed, it is the prescribed form of prayer.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Thus saith the <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord,</span> the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</q></p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Isaiah 45:11</p>

  <header><h3>Meditation</h3></header>
  <p>Any time we are in prayer, we <i>meditate.</i> Meditation is simply the rational dwelling on what we are saying. We can, similarly, meditate on a reading by consciously thinking through its effects and letting it have effect on us in the mind. We deliberately turn our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">minds</a> to think about the Divine and His gifts.</p>
  <p>This turning of our mind has an effect on us, too, that reaches beyond the moments on which we are specifically thinking about those things. In turning our mind, instead of dwelling on sin and the things of this world, we dwell on and infect ourselves with the love of Christ. Turning to Him in a few moments supplies us with a supply to turn to Him in every moment. In fact, we are called to do this,</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Finally, brehtren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Philippians 4:8</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>A lot of times, we have problems with <i>rumination,</i> i.e., <q>playing</q> over and over again some memory or thought that gives us anxiety. If we find ourselves in these ruts, it is no use to say <q>Stop thinking about that!</q> because that will only make that the problem worse. Instead, we must find something else to think on, and what better to think on than the things of God?</p>
  <section>
	<header><h4>The Rosary</h4></header>
	<p>During the Rosary, we have mysteries, the proscribed things to think upon. These should not distract us from the words of our prayer. Instead, we meditate on the words and also on the wonders of the life of Christ in which Our Blessed Mother participated. We think on these things. These aren't empty <i>imaginings</i> of the things going on; this would surely lead us into <a href="/mystic/illusion.html">illusion</a>. Rather, we think specifically on those events just as we would if we meditated on any other reading or scripture or event. All the same, while we are saying the words of the prayers, we should be sincerely meaning them in our heads also.</p>

  <header><h3>Contemplation</h3></header>
  <p>Any time we are in prayer, we also <i>contemplate.</i> <a href="/prayer/contemplation.html">Contemplation</a> is the opening of our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">hearts</a> to divine love and inspiration.<a class="footref" id="ref2" href="#note2" title="N.B. In regular language, contemplation is usually just seen as a strong form of meditation, but when the mystics and theologians write, they mean these terms in more specific ways.">2</a> This is particularly profound. In contemplation, we go to this <i>inner man,</i> and we allow him to return the graces of walking with God that we lost in the Garden of Eden.</p>
  <p>The Carmelite Order considers this kind of prayer to be its Charism.</p>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Lectio Divina</h4></header>
	<p>In <i>Lectio Divina,</i> we first <i>read</i> a passage of scripture or some other reading. Then, we <i>meditate</i> and think on its content. Then, we <i>pray.</i> Note, this whole process is prayer, but in this stage of the Lectio Divina, we pray on things related to what we have read and meditated on. We ask for <i>intercession</i> and also <i>inspiration</i> for the next step. Finally, we <i>contemplate.</i> We sit in the silence of our hearts, asking God to show his love and communicate to us, lovingly accepting his divine light and kingdom into our heart.</p>

  <header><h3>Prayer of the Body, Mind, and Heart</h3></header>
  <p>The Eastern mystics talk about three <i>degrees</i> of prayer. Again, as I stated above, prayer resists rigid classification as such, but these are helpful guidelines for one's spiritual journey.</p>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Prayer of the Body</h4></header>
	<p>The prayer of the body is the prayer of the lips. When we say words aloud and prostrate ourselves, work in the <i>orans</i> position, etc., we engage in the prayer of the body. We must be careful not to regard this kind of prayer as wholly unspiritual. Indeed, if we do not mean the words we say, no communication happens and our prayer is empty&mdash;if it is to be even called prayer. All the same, the prayer of the body may still be esteemed.</p>
	<p>Perhaps the source of regarding the prayer of the body as unspiritual is founded in that only praying in the body can lead us into dangerous illusion. We may pridefully puff ourselves up, thinking we are at the spiritual summit when in reality we are at the base of the mountain. This is illustrated in the Gospels.</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>&mdash;Luke 18:10&ndash;13</p>
	<div class="afterquote"></div>
	<p>This story illustrates a fundamental truth concerning the prayer of the body. If we are filled with pride and merely proclaim to all with our lips how spiritual we are, we fall into pride and false spirituality. If, however, we come in humility as the publican, we lay down at the feet of God, admitting that we are not spiritual but rather carnal, and beg his mercy. The scriptures say the publican smote his breast. This is an ancient gesture of humility and contrition. We do it in the act of contrition, saying, <q>through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.</q> This, also, is prayer of the body, and through prostrations and strikes, we can show our humility. But to think that this is the summit of spiritual perfection is to fall into perdition.</p>
	<section>
	  <header><h5>Public Prayer</h5></header>
	  <p>A particular aspect of the prayer of the body that deserves special attention is the aspect of <i>public prayer and worship.</i> The entirety of the Eucharist is a prayer, primarily said by the priest but (hopefully) with the congregation also participating, uplifting and worshipping Christ, our Lord and Savior. Also, all the faithful can (and should!) participate in the Liturgy of the Hours, which, similarly, includes songs and psalms of praise and is meant to be recited publicly. Public prayer is part of Christian practice, but, again, if it is the only part of our practice, we fall into dangerous <a href="/mystic/illusion.html">illusion</a>.</p>

	<header><h4>Prayer of the Mind</h4></header>
	<p>The Prayer of the Mind is the meditation on what is being said&mdash;the <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">mind's</a> conscious reflection on the words said. The prayer of the mind is true communication with God; we make sure we <i>mean</i> what we say.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
	<header><h4>Prayer of the Heart</h4></header>
	<p>Descending further is the prayer of the heart. This is also called true prayer. In the prayer of the heart, we order our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">heart</a> and mind to glorifying God and communicating with Him. Bishop Theophan the Recluse says that we are to, <q>descend with the mind into the heart.</q> In other words, we still reflect intellectually on what is said, but we also order our affections, feelings, thoughts, heart, and soul to the Word of God. We order our entire being into His presence. Remember, God has breathed a little of Himself into each one of us, so this is what is meant as standing in the heart. We go to the spirit, the inner man, and worship God in His light there.</p>
