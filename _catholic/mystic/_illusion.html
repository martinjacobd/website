<p>Another technical term the mystics like to use is the term <em>illusion.</em> This is how the Russian term прелесть (prelest) and Greek term πλάνη (plani) are translated. The Russian version of this word comes from a root meaning cajolery or charm, and we would do good to heed this. The root of illusion is to accept something as providing spiritual benefit or relation to God when it doesn't. In its most extreme form, illusion is demonic, substituting communications with evil with those with God. The distal cause of illusion in the heart is ultimately pride. By pride, we think we have reached a level of spirituality, so puffed up, we go on and delude ourselves into thinking we are part of the divine. We fall into illusion when we credit things of the world&mdash;products of our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">mind</a> or imaginations, demonic manifestations, even relationships&mdash;with making us whole.</p>

<p>Dr. Raymond Lloyd Richmond on his <a href="http://www.chastitysf.com/">Chastity&mdash;In San Francisco?</a> website has a <a href="http://www.chastitysf.com/q_illusions.htm">wonderful webpage</a>[His entire website is lovely in general, and was a fantastic help in my own conversion.] about the psychological and unconscious origins of illusions in all of our lives. I will dwell, then, not on the unconscious proximal cause of illusion&mdash;i.e., vainly identifying with an outside fraudulent world. I will focus, rather, on how to avoid this.</p>

  <header><h3>Humility</h3></header>
  <p>Humility is the only way to avoid falling into illusion. When we go to God in prayer, we shouldn't go expecting Him to give us feelings so that we can special or expecting that just because we encant a formula He is <i>obligated</i> to give us something or do something for us. We ought never to think that we have achieved what He wants. We ought never to think that we are somehow special. We aren't. While we are here on this earth, we are wretched, poor beings who are gulfed from God by an infinite chasm only divine Grace in the sacrifice of the Cross&mdash;indeed, that not of ourselves, the free gift of God&mdash;can cross. To think that we can cross this by ourselves, we commit the same fatal sin as Satan&mdash;pridefully boasting that we are as good as God.</p>
  <p>We are to flee from all pride then. When we hear locutions or see apparitions, we are always to regard these in a careful light and never to seek these out as an end in itself. Our only end is the glorification of God, and the desire to seek spiritual feelings so that we can exalt ourselves is a most pernicious evil. Instead, when we pray, we go into the inner closet of the heart. We do not boast as the Pharisees, thinking ourselves at the summit of spirituality; instead, we strike our breast as the publican and submit ourselves to God.</p>
  <p>It is for this reason the Jesus prayer is prayed. Notice the prayer first calls upon the name of Jesus and recognizes His divinity and sovereignty. The very first words of the prayer orient us in the most lowly position compared to our most precious Savior. We cry out "Lord! Jesus Christ!" proclaiming His name and divinity, a name and power which forces the demons to tremble.[James 2:19] Next, again, we recognize His divinity, "Son of God." Now, in our most lowly estate in comparison, we beg His mercy. In our wretchedness, there is nothing else we could ask for. Truly praying the prayer this way is the way we flee from pride. As soon as we seek to be special by chasing apparitions or false spiritual feelings, we fall into illusion; we are duped by demons into believing a fraud. Jesus tells us to seek and we will find. So, we must continue seeking. As soon as we stop seeking, we will stop finding.</p>
  <p>James warns us of this spiritual pride.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;James 2:18-20</p>

  <p>We see here the remedy also: works&mdash;namely, the Cross. When we work in sacrifice, prayer, and obedience, when we take up our own cross as the Lord instructed us to, we fly to true religion and put aside all fantasies and illusions of being special and spiritual.</p>

  <header><h3>The Danger of the Use of Imagination</h3></header>
  <p>The Eastern monastics caution us against using our <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">imaginations</a> during prayer.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>Hold no intermediate image between you and God.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;Bishop Theophan the Recluse[Quoted in <cite>The Art of Prayer: An Orthodox Anthology,</cite> p. 100]</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>What, then, should we make of the meditations in the rosary and other things? This is clear from the writings of St. John of the Cross. He writes, starting in <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/john_cross/ascent.v.xii.html">Chapter XII of Book II of <cite>The Ascent of Mount Carmel</cite></a> about the evils of being <i>attached</i> to these imaginations, and there we find the crux of the matter. It is the attachment which produces the illusion. Just as an inordinate attachment to a relationship will lead us into the illusory thinking that that person will make us whole, so the inordinate attachment to these images makes us think that we are in a closer communion with God than we are. When we meditate, we should think but be careful not to imagine. Of course, images will come to mind, but we ought not indulge these. For in so doing, we may find that we <i>feel</i> in closer communion to God than we are, and this is a sure path to illusion. The rosary is a wonderful prayer, and we ought always to meditate on the mysteries of the divine life of Christ, but we do not indulge fantasies about them. This is surely degrading and illusory. Indeed, images will come up, but we do not indulge them instead of&mdash;or <i>hold inbetween</i>&mdash;God.</p>
