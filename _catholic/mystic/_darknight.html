<header><h2>The Dark Night of the Soul</h2></header>
<p>A metaphysical perspective of the suffering of believers&mdash;and why we have to forsake our flesh for the Lord&mdash;lies in our opposition to the world.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. He that hateth me hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>

  <header><h3>Lacan's Metaphysics</h3></header>
  <p>The Cross of Christ lies in direct opposition to the World. Christ made a dividing line when He made His sacrifice. We live in the world, and those who are of the world will not understand our lives. So, we will suffer. The flesh cannot comprehend God.[John 1:5] So, when we are given to earthly appetites and only experience happiness, we do not rejoice in God but in the World. This is a great gift. This is what John of the Cross referred to as the Dark Night of the Soul. It's dark, because to the senses of the <a href="/mystic/makeup.html">soul,</a> God is darkness. We cannot see Him. We cannot hear Him. We cannot touch Him. It is only in darkness to our senses and flesh that we can experience the Light of the Spirit.</p>
  <p>It is a trauma, in a Lacanian sense. French Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan proposed that all persons (Subjects) exist within a framework of the Other. This domain, the Other, contains all language and symbolism&mdash;all things which people can say they are or are a part of. He had a famous saying, &ldquo;There is no other of the Other.&rdquo; This means, all of our language, all of our symbols, all of our institutions only have meaning in terms of each other. This is demonstrated, e.g., in Genesis, when Adam must name the animals. God gave the use of language up to Adam. He didn't make any language which can convey all Real meanings. There is always a disconnect between record and reality.</p>
  <p>In Aristotalean metaphysics has an imperfect analogue to this. We see things as having form, matter, essence, and accidents. The accidents of a subject (i.e., the outer form of a subject) point to an essence. (E.g., we recognize humans by their outward form, but their outward form is not what makes them human.) As such, we can only describe things to an extent based on their outward form. For instance, Jesus is still human despite that we no longer may see His body. Of course, His body still exists, as it is a <i>part</i> of being Human; it simply isn't the end of being human. We will participate in this mystery as our own bodies are resurrected. Our humanity is not illusory, but rather it exists and is very real and cannot be qualified completely, even with all of the words in the universe.</p>

  <header><h3>The Trauma of God's Being</h3></header>
  <p>God traumatizes the Other of Lacan by being the standard. He said &ldquo;<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">I am that I am.</span>&rdquo; He is indeed what is. He relies on nothing else to identify himself. Jesus makes statements identifying Himself as God also. John records seven of these, identifying Jesus as fully God, as His own standard which needs no Other reference.</p>
  <p>The exegesis of this quote is tricky. The verb used here is usually translated  “I will be.” Biblical Hebrew has no tense as such. It is an aspectual language, i.e., verbs are qualified only by <i>perfective</i> and <i>imperfective</i> aspect, but the perfective is still used in prophetic contexts, because these matters are so clear. So, though this verb is usually translated “I will be,” the translation of “I am” is legitimate, especially considering that early translations kept the present tense. For instance, the septuagint's “ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν,” (ego eimi ho on) is properly translated “I am the being,” (tense preserved). The significance of this is that God doesn't have to identify Himself by our standards. He stands alone, all that which is flows from Him. (And by the ontological principle, He is greater than all which is.) He hasn't to identify with anything in language. He doesn't have to conform to any standard or noun or adjective that we can put to Him. He is who is.</p>
  <p>The ambiguity of tense here in the original Hebrew is useful, it can identify as God who “Is and who was and who always shall be unto the ages of ages,” as we affirm in the doxology.</p>
  <p>Of course, Jesus is God also, in the person of the Son of God. We affirm a certain trauma in His being both divine and human. He is the uncreated word. This sign value is made most apparent in the Gospel of John.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;John 1:1&ndash;5</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>We see here a painting of Jesus as the eternal Word, the ordering principle of the universe, through which everything was made and ordered. Sin, is the disturbance of this order. He identifies this Word with God. John had a special exposition of the divinity, by affirming His uncreatedness (the words translated “In the beginning&hellip;” viz., Ἐν ἀρχῇ, carry an idea of “from time immemorial”) and using seven <span style="font-variant: small-caps">I am</span> statements, namely,</p>
  <ul>
	<li>I am the Bread of Life. (6:35)</li>
	<li>I am the Light of the World. (8:12)</li>
	<li>I am the Gate of the Sheep. (10:7)</li>
	<li>I am the Good Shepherd. (10:11)</li>
	<li>I am the Resurrection and the Life. (11:25)</li>
	<li>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. (14:6)</li>
	<li>I am the True Vine. (15:1)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>God mystically reveals his nature through these statements, identifying Himself as sovereign over all things and as giving all things life and guidance. He shows in glory His nature through two other statements in this Gospel, too. In John 8:58, He says, “Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.” The Jews immediately saw this as his identifying with God, attempting at stoning Him for blasphemy in the next verse.</p>
  <p>This poses a special problem for Jesus's coming as a man. We mostly see Humans as finite beings, posessing only certain powers and knowledge. Jesus's posessing two natures&mdash;human and divine&mdash;was traumatic in that He existed in perfection, in perfect humanity. We see Him as the ultimate human. He became Man and never erred from the proper nature of humans, of which He was the orderer, the eternal Logos. He purified the Human Essence and showed what it was like to be not fallen, to be the perfect lamb. He then rose to the cross, so that we may also become partakers of the Divine Nature, through His Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>We must always remember that the flesh, through the concupiscence Adam gave, is traumatized through this. Opposites cannot coexist. Either we will choose not to mortify the flesh and be denied participation in the Divine, or we will choose to leave behind the things of this world and accumulate treasure in Heaven. He exists in opposition to all things flesh, all things which must qualify themselves otherwise, and so these things cannot be together with Him. This is what Our Lord signified when said that it will be easier for a camel to fit through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of Heaven. Anyone who wishes to take their riches as part of them will have their whole cast into the fire. This was the young ruler's error. He had kept the words of the law, but he had not allowed himself to be transformed and purified in them.</p>
  <p>The fullness of sign was given when Jesus was arrested in the garden.</p>
  <blockquote>
	<p>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them. As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&mdash;John 1&ndash;8</p>
  <div class="afterquote"></div>
  <p>Surrounded and overtaken by His divine glory and presence, the officers could not help but lay down. They're fleshly nature and mission could not coexist with the Glory of the divinity.</p>

  <header><h3>The Dark Night of the Soul</h3></header>
  <p>What does this have to do with John of the Cross's Dark Night of the Soul? John affirms over and again as since our fleshly nature and God's Divinity cannot coincide, we must forsake our flesh to be partakers of the Divine nature. We must allow our flesh to be traumatized, that we may inherit the Kingdom, even within our own hearts here on earth.</p>
