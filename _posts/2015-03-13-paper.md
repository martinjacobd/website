I was the secondary author on a paper "Timelike Surfaces of Revolution with Constant Mean Curvature in de Sitter 3-space" ([preprint](http://www.math.usm.edu/lee/tlcmcrevds.pdf)) with [Dr. Sung Lee](http://www.math.usm.edu/lee/) at the University of Southern Mississippi.  This paper was recently accepted into the [International Electronic Journal of Geometry](http://www.iejgeo.com/main.php) (Vol. 8, No. 1 (2015)).

In the paper, we explored [minimal surfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surfaces).  Minimal surfaces are the same as so-called soap film surfaces--if a soap film is constrained to flow around a specific volume, it will make a surface which minimizes the surface area required to enclose the bounded volume.  As a related example, power lines form a surface called a [catenary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary) because this minimizes the tension on the lines.  You can imagine the surface enclosed my a soap film with two bounds of circles (called a [catenoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenoid)) as a surface of revolution of a catenary.  (You can imagine this surface by imagining taking two bubble wands and putting them side-by-side into soap, taking them out and pulling them apart.)

We did not study these surfaces in standard Euclidean space, however.  We studied it in the curved [de Sitter 3-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Sitter_space).  This surface is a sphere in [Minkowski 4-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime) with three spacelike and one timelike axis (i.e., with metric tensor \\((+ + + -)\\)).  Minkowski spacetime is the space in which relativity may be most simply formulated, and the de Sitter space is simply a sphere within this spacetime.  We proved that Gauss's equation for minimal surfaces worked in the de Sitter space and used that to construct a differential equation describing the surface of revolution.  We proved that as the curvature of the sphere approaches zero, these minimal surfaces of revolution approach exactly those found in flat Minkowski spacetime.
