Piketty famously predicted (not described) the economic principle that the rate of return on capital (\\( r \\)) is going to rise with respect to the growth rate of the economy (\\(g\\)) in the coming years here in America, fueling an already-growing wealth disparity (dubbed "\\(r - g > 0\\)").  He goes on to say that the primary driver of growing wealth disparity *now* is rising salaries for top income-earners relative to that of average wage-workers.  There are many well-written [critiques](http://www.mit.edu/~mrognlie/piketty_diminishing_returns.pdf) of his proposed principle, and I do not have the expertise to comment on whether what he said represents a realistic view.  The most interesting thing to come out of this is the *opposition* and discussion surrounding what he said and also that we don't have any good data on wealth.

(I realize the irony in my saying that.) In fact, [a particularly satisfying Wall Street Journal article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303825604579515452952131592) asserts the legitimacy of high salaries while accusing Piketty of inciting class warfare.

This all begs a fundamental question: *Why are we so adamant about &lt;position&gt; on this subject?*  What is so divisive about wealth inequality?  Is it the left's insistence on *forced* correction?  Is it the right's insistence that wealth inequality is fundamentally amoral?  Sometimes it seems opinions on wealth inequality are more divisive than the actual inequality itself.  Many, many people are against the 80% wealth tax Piketty proposes.  In fact, the controversy over Piketty is the sign of an underlying trend.  The United States spent many resources combating the ideology of Marxism-Leninism (and even Maoism) back in its heyday.  In fact, few people even bother to consider the philosophy in America today.  Instead, we have many on the left who pander to the notion that *small* increases in taxes can fix the income gap.  Is the sign that the bourgeouisie are stingy?  Was Marx right that eventually the Proletariat will rebel and keep to themselves the means of production?

Everybody also has his own solution to the inequality gap.  Bill Gates [advocates a large consumption tax](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-Inequality-Matters-Capital-in-21st-Century-Review/) to solve the problem, allowing the wealthy to philanthropize and invest privately while discouraging unlimited consumption.<a name="label1"></a><sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup>  The left like higher taxes; the right like deregulation and laissez-faire.

There is clearly very strong, underlying social tension here.  The most interesting thing is: What will happen of it?  Will the government pander to rich interests and allow wealth inequality to grow or will it pander to populism and increase taxes/other incentives.  This is non-trivial.  As I mentioned earlier, our entire economic philosophies are gathered around who own the wealth (or "means of production" if you prefer).  Our entire economic direction hinges on this, and there is a lot of social tension.

In Lacanian fashion, this unspeakable tension is reflected in violence from time-to-time.  The recent riots in London and Greece, uprising throughout Europe, even the French Revolution.  There is a mismatch between reality and what we can say or talk about.

This is a strange idea, but hear me out.  There is no good data on wealth inequality.<sup>[2]</sup>  We cannot even empirically address this issue.  There is necessarily mismatch between reality, what we know--and can say--and what our ideology suggests.  So, everybody resolves this in themselves somehow--violently or otherwise.  Nobody's ideology has worked.  There is still wealth inequality.  This is wrong to us.  We want something, but the way we know to get it doesn't work.

How this all will be resolved matters vastly more than Piketty's bad data.

<a name="ref1"></a><a href="#label1">1.</a> Interestingly, at first glance, this will incentivize the wealthy to invest and grow their wealth rather than spend it, granted this will also incentivize the wealthy to use their money for "good."  He notes that current wealth in America does not come from disproportionately grown old-money, which is true, but this misses the point that Piketty was being prescriptive and not descriptive.
