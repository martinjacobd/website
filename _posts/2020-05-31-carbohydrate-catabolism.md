Carbohydrates are listed, along with protein and fat, as one of the three major "macronutrients." Today, we will discuss exactly what happens when you eat carbohydrates from the very first bite.<a class="footref" id="ref1" href="#note1" title="Sometimes you see carbohydrate in the singular as a mass noun like food, but most persons use it in the plural.">1</a> First, let us look at the nomenclature for the different kinds of carbohydrates.

## Monosaccharides
The simplest type of carbohydrate is the monosaccharide. There are many monosaccharides, but four are important dietarily: glucose,<a class="footref" id="ref2" href="#note2" title="Glucose is also known as dextrose when derived from corn.">2</a> fructose, mannose, and galactose. All other carbohydrates are made up of chains of monosaccharides. If you are interested in the full metabolic pathways involved in the metabolism of these sugars, there is a [great diagram](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metabolism_of_common_monosaccharides,_and_related_reactions.png) on WikiMedia Commons. We will ignore mannose and galactose, because they make up relatively little of dietary consumption and are similar enough to glucose metabolically speaking not to go into. 

Fructose and glucose, however, differ significantly enough to go into detail about both.

### Glucose Metabolism and Glycolysis

Every cell in the human can metabolize glucose. Indeed, every eukaryotic cell on the earth can metabolize glucose, and most prokaryotic cells can too. It is no exaggeration to say it is the most important energy source on the planet.

The small intestine absorbs glucose when it is ingested and then secretes it into the blood. In response to the rising glucose levels, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. Adipocytes (fat cells) take the cue from insulin to absorb glucose from the blood, and they can manufacture new fatty acids from the glucose (lipogenesis) or just use the glucose for their own energy needs. The liver also uptakes some glucose, depositing it as glycogen (long chains of glucose that can be readily used). The liver also uses this insulin to stop gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose by the body) and glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen into glucose molecules). Other cells also see the insulin signal and respond by absorbing glucose for their energy needs.

In the interior of the cell, several enzymes work together to glycolyze glucose into pyruvate, which the cell can then decarboxylate into acetyl-CoA, which enters the [citric acid cycle]({% post_url 2020-05-30-citric-acid %}). The cell can use all of the intermediates of glycolysis and none of them are toxic or harmful. Reactive oxygen species ("oxidants") aren't created, and the body handles this very well. Glucose can also be used as a building block or converted into other monosaccharides to build the things it needs. (Notably glucose can become ribose, necessary for RNA and DNA, which are necessary for building proteins, enzymes, hormones, etc.)

Two salient disorders of glucose metabolism occur. In type-1 diabetes, the pancreas cannot secrete sufficient insulin (or sometimes any insulin at all) to control blood glucose. In type-2 diabetes, the liver and fat cells become "insulin resistant." They do not respond to insulin to uptake enough glucose to adequately control blood glucose concentrations. This makes the pacreas work harder and hard to produce more insulin. In extremely late-stage type-2 diabetes, the pancreas can become so damaged that it cannot produce sufficient insulin at all. One sometimes hears "insulin resistance" as a subclinical variety of this where the cells are beginning not to respond as quickly or as well to insulin as they ought, but it doesn't rise to the level of a metabolic disorder like diabetes.

### Fructose Metabolism

Several kinds of tissue can metabolize fructose, but for the most part the small intestine absorbs fructose which then enters the [hepatic portal vein.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_vein) The liver then does most of the processing of fructose. Fructose has its own metabolic pathways. The liver can convert it into glucose, can add it to its store of hepatic glycogen, or convert it to triglycerides. Dr. Robert Lustig, among others, [has fingered](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2010.41) these last two systems as being partially or even mostly responsible for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome.

In particular, Dr. Lustig has [likened fructose](https://academic.oup.com/advances/article/4/2/226/4591631) to alcohol, with its toxic side-products and contribution to fatty liver. Indeed, one of the side effects of alcohol catabolism is acetaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde, from fructose, is a similar molecule. They both can damage the cell through the creation of reactive oxygen species. He gave [an interesting talk](https://robertlustig.com/fructose2/) about the phenomenon of fructose and NAFLD, a follow-up to a [former talk](https://robertlustig.com/sugar-the-bitter-truth/) on the same subject that went somewhat viral. I think he overstates the effect of fructose (and understates the effect of glucose, starch, and insulin resistance); nevertheless, he is a the pediatric endocrinologist, and I am just a schmuck.

## Disaccharides

A disaccharide consists of two monosaccharides chemically bound together. Sucrose (table sugar) is a disaccharide of one fructose and one glucose. Maltose is a disaccharide of two glucoses. Metabolically speaking, these disaccharides aren't terribly different their monosaccharide constituents. Often stomach acid itself is strong enough to split disaccharides into their constituent parts. But enzymes exist in the small intestine and even the salive to break them apart. In the case of maltose, the enzyme maltase cleaves it into two glucose molecules before the small intestine endothelial cells absorb the glucoses. Similarly, sucrase cleaves sucrose into one glucose and one fructose.

An interesting note: Lactose intolerance is caused by a (usually congenital) lack of the enzyme lactase. THe body cannot, in this case, cleave lactose into glucose and galactose. Thus, bacteria in the intestine ferment it instead, causing gas and dietary distress.

## Oligosaccharides and Polysaccharides

<p class="caption">Amylose (pictured above) is a constituent of starch. It consists of hundreds of glucose molecules bound together. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amylose2.svg">Original image</a> placed in the public domain by its owner, NEUROtiker on WikiMedia Commons.</p>

Oligo- and polysaccharides are longer chains of monosaccharides. Generally speaking, oligosaccharides have about 7-10 monosaccharides, and polysaccharides are usually much longer (reaching into the hundreds or thousands of individual monosaccharide constituents). Like disaccharides, the small intestine secretes enzymes to break these large molecules down into their constituent parts, if they are absorbed into the body. However, there are some polysaccharides that cannot be broken down by the body. We call undigestible carbohydrates dietary fiber. 

### Fiber
Fiber comes in two forms: soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber can be dissolved in water. This fiber can reach the *large* intestine, where intestinal bacteria can ferment it into short-chain fatty acids that are then absorbed by the body. That's right: Some carbohydrates become fat before being absorbed into the body proper. "Resistant starch" has been chemically modified to do a similar thing. Insoluble fiber mostly passes through the body unchanged. It can help with bowel movements. Both kinds of fiber can slow the absorption of carbohydrates by being weakly bound to them and "shielding" them from the actions of the enzymes that seek to split them apart.

## Pulling It All Together: The Glycemic Index
One interesting metric to look at is how much a particular carbohydrate raises blood sugar. The glycemic index of food gives us insight into this. Pure glucose has a glycemic index of 100. Fructose actually only has a glycemic index of 19 (meaning that in equal amounts it would only raise blood sugar about 19% of glucose). Maltose (two glucoses together) has a glycemic index of 104, meaning it raises blood sugar even more than pure glucose! Dietary fiber generally has a glycemic index of 0. It does not raise blood sugar measurably and may even slow the action of other foods on blood glucose. Paying attention to how much food one is eating that raises blood sugar appreciably may be important for the insulin resistant.
